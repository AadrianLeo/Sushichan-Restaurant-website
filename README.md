# Sushichan-Restaurant-website

The project is a static dummy website showcasing a Japanese sushi restaurant. It has been developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
with AOS for animations and responsive design for seamless viewing on different screen resolutions. 
The website offers an immersive experience, 
with captivating visuals and a user-friendly interface. 
This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development and attention to detail. 
Please note that this is a fictional website created for educational purposes and does not represent an actual restaurant. 
Explore the code and project files to learn more.
Thank you for your interest!
